General note for the following functions:                                    *
int MEAPI Ix*LineSegment(const McdModelID inBox,                             *
                           MeReal* const inOrig, MeReal* const inDest,       *
                           McdLineSegIntersectResult * info );               *
 - The function returns 1 if an intersection is found, otherwise returns 0   *
 - inOrig and inDest are in world's c.s.                                     *
 - info->isctPoint is in world's c.s. In case of box and sphere, it's the    *
   first intersection point from inOrig                                      *
 - info->normal is the normal vector from the input CxGeometry type object   *
   at the intersection point, also in world's c.s.                           *
 - info->distance is the REAL distance from inOrig to the intersection point *
   (not a parametrized distance).                                            *
 - When the inOrig point is inside of box or sphere, there is no             *
   info->normal is returned and info->distance = 0                           *
