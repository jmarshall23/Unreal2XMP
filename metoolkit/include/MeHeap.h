/** @file
  Priority queue based on a heap implementation.

  This doesn't allocate any memory.  You must allocate the heap header
  and the array of void pointers in whatever way you want.

  The performance of MeHeap is O(log n) for push/pop.

  To use it:

    //  make a record.
    typedef struct { int key; char blah[80]; } rec;

    //  record comparison function
    int cmp(const void *a, const void *b) 
    {
        return ((rec*)a)->key < ((rec*)b)->key;
    }

    void foo()
    {
        MeHeap h;
        void *m[500];

        MeHeapInit(&h, m, 500, cmp);    // initialize heap

        // put two items into the heap
        rec r1 = { 1, "hello" };
        rec r2 = { 2, "foobar" };
        MeHeapPush(&h, &r1); 
        MeHeapPush(&h, &r2);       

        rec *p = (rec*) MeHeapPop(&h);   // get the lowest record
    }

  In this sample, since the key is an int and the first thing in the
  struct, we could have just passed 0 for the comparison, instead of
  bothering to write the cmp function.
