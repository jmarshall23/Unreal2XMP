    This joint attaches one body to another, or to the inertial
    reference frame, at a given separation.  This separation
    is governed by two limits which may both be "hard" (which
    simulates a rod or strut joint) or both soft (simulating a
    spring) or hard on one limit but soft on the other (e.g. an
    elastic attachment which may be stretched but not compressed).
    The default behaviour is spring-like, with two soft, damped
    limits, both initialised at the initial separation of the
    bodies.
