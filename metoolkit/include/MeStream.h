    Streaming functions. This is not a proper streaming implementation.
    For platforms that support streaming, MeStream just wraps the function
    fopen/fclose/fread/fwrite. For platforms that don't support streaming,
    the functions open/close/read/write are used. MeStream is used in case
    we want to implement a full streaming solution on all platforms.
