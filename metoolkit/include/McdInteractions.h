    Queries on the geometrical relationship between a pair of McdModel
    objects. The principal query is McdIntersect(), which computes contacts.

    All pairwise queries are performed using McdModelPair objects.  The
    interactions rely on a retained-mode mechanism: Before a McdModelPair
    object is used in any of the interaction functions, you must prepare it
    by calling McdHello(). After that point, the object can be used on any
    available interaction functions, over multiple time steps in the
    simulation. When the McdModelPair object is no longer needed ( for
    example the pair of models involved are no longer in close proximity ),
    McdGoodbye() must be called on it.

    The continuity of McdModelPair identity, and keeping track of
    hello/goodbye events are managed automatically when you obtain your
    McdModelPair objects using McdSpace.

    The actual underlying algorithms depend on the actual geometry types of
    each McdModel object in the pair.
    The retained-mode mechanism  is exploited by
    some of these algorithms, which may employ
    coherence-based techniques, or perform pairwise pre-processing
    operations when a given pair is first encountered.

    Both the geometry types and the
    interaction algorithms must be explicitly registered with the Mcd
    system at initialization. If, for a particular geometry type - geometry
    type combination, there is no algorithm registered or available, the
    interaction will simply be ignored.
