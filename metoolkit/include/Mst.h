/** @file
 * MathEngine Simulation Toolkit Main Header.
 * This library provides useful functions for creating and simulating objects
 * using both the MathEngine Dynamics Toolkit and the MathEngine Collision
 * Toolkit.
 * An MstUniverse contains an McdSpace collision farfield, an MdtWorld, an
 * MstBridge, and some buffers for moving contacts between MCD and MDT.
 * MstUniverseCreate creates these things in one handy function.
 * A collision McdModel is the main structure, with an optional dynamics
 * MdtBody associated with it.
 * Mst contains functions for creating these together (for convenience),
 * or seperately and associating them with each other using McdModelSetBody.
 * It can also set the mass and inertia tensor of an MdtBody to a sensible
 * default based on the collision geometry and a density.
 * MstUniverseStep is a dynamics and collision 'main loop'.
