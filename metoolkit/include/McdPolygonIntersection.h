  The normal and distance determines the projection plane.  All the points
  in poly1 and poly2 are assumed to lie on (or close to) this plane.

  This function messes up poly1 and poly2, they are flattened to
  a coordinate plane and sorted using qsort.

  The caller MUST allocate sufficient space for polyOut.  The maximum
  size required is 2*min(numpoly1, numpoly2).
