  <li>DUMPNATIVES: Display a list of unused native function ids.</li>

  <li>EDITACTOR CLASS=classname: During game play, edits the properties of the nearest actor

    belonging to that class. Cool for debugging.</li>

  <li>ENDFULLSCREEN: Go back to playing in a window.</li>

  <li>EXEC filename: Execute the console commands in the filename, default is in the System

    directory.</li>

  <li>EXIT: Exit the program.</li>

  <li>HIDEACTORS: Hide actors during game play.</li>

  <li>JUMPTO x y z: In UnrealEd, move the viewport to a certain X,Y,Z location, useful in

    conjunction with tester reports generated with the REPORT command.</li>

  <li>LOADGAME num: Load a game in position 0-9.</li>

  <li>MARK: Mark all objects that are in memory (for garbage collection debugging in

    conjunction with MARKCHECK).</li>

  <li>MARKCHECK: Display a list of all unmarked objects that are in memory (for garbage

    collection debugging in conjunction with MARK).</li>

  <li>MEM: List memory usage; only works when Unreal is compiled with the memory-tracking

    option (it's usually not).</li>

  <li>MEMSTAT: Show Windows overall memory statistics.</li>

  <li>MUSICORDER num: Change to a certain track in the song (0=ambient, 1=action, 2=suspense).</li>

  <li>OBJ CLASSES: Prints a list of all loaded classes.</li>

  <li>OBJ DEPENDENCIES PACKAGE=pkgname EXCLUDE1=otherpackage EXCLUDE2=otherpackage...: !!</li>

    objects.&nbsp; If the inside object isn't specified, shows all objects.&nbsp; Gives a

    summary of memory usage.&nbsp; This is very useful during game play for figuring out how

    much memory is being used.&nbsp; In UnrealEd, this statistic isn't useful because a huge

    amount of extra stuff is loaded which might not be used by your map.</li>

  <li>OBJ REFS CLASS=objectclass NAME=objectname: Show a list of objects which reference the

    object you specify.&nbsp; When trimming memory usage, this is useful for figuring out why

    some object is being loaded.</li>

    &quot;KILLALL UNREALI.BRUTE&quot;.</li>

  <li>KILLPAWNS: Kills all monsters.</li>

  <li>PLAYERSONLY: Pauses all non-player actors in the game. Cool for debugging scripts,

    taking screenshots.</li>

  <li>SWITCHLEVEL &lt;new level URL&gt;: Causes the server (or local machine, in a

    single-player game) to switch to a new level.</li>

</ul>



<h3>Console configuration commands</h3>



<ul>

  <li>GET &lt;classname&gt; &lt;variablename&gt;</li>

</ul>



<p>Gets a configurable class parameter.&nbsp; &lt;classname&gt; may be a partial

classname, such as &quot;playerpawn&quot;, or a qualified classname such as

&quot;engine.playerpawn&quot;.&nbsp; The class must be loaded in memory, otherwise GET

returns an empty string.&nbsp; &lt;variablename&gt; must be the name of a variable that is

designated as configurable (either in UnrealScript using the &quot;config&quot; keyword or

in C++ using CPF_Config).&nbsp; This returns the value of the configured variable,

converted to a string.&nbsp; The value returned by GET reflects the class's default value

(for scripted classes, this is the default value that was set for the class using its

property sheet).&nbsp; At any time, zero or more instances of objects belonging to

&lt;classname&gt; may be in memory, and may have modified values of &lt;variablename&gt;,

and they don't affect the value returned by &quot;GET&quot;. 



<ul>

  <li>SET &lt;classname&gt; &lt;variablename&gt; &lt;value&gt;</li>

</ul>



<p>Sets the default value of a class's variable.&nbsp; If the class is designated as

configurable (using the &quot;config&quot; keyword in UnrealScript or CLASS_Config in

C++), and so is the variable, this function updates the Unreal.ini file to reflect the new

default value. If any instances of objects belonging to &lt;classname&gt; are in memory,

all of those objects are updated.&nbsp; When an object's config variables are updated,

they are notified as follows: 



<ol>

  <li>The object's PreEditChange() function is called, basically saying &quot;Get ready to be

    modified!&quot;</li>

  <li>The object's configurable variables are updated with the newly configured values.</li>

  <li>The object's PostEditChange() function is called, saying &quot;You've been modified, so

    validate and update yourself&quot;.</li>

</ol>



<p>This procedure enables objects to validate their configurable properties and update

themselves.&nbsp; For example, the audio subsystem's PostEditChange() function clamps the

sound volume to a safe range of 0.0 - 1.0 (because the SET command enables users to set it

to ridiculous values) and then updates the actual volume of the sound effects that are

playing.</p>



<h3>Unreal Key Bindings</h3>



<p>In the Unreal key bindings (under Advanced Options / Advanced / Raw Key Bindings), you

can associate console commands and other special input commands with key presses and

releases.&nbsp; In the text box next to a key name, you can type in one or more console

commands, separated by the &quot;|&quot; character.&nbsp; For example, to bind the

&quot;S&quot; key to the &quot;Jump&quot; alias, type this:</p>



<pre>    Jump</pre>



<p>That causes the &quot;Jump&quot; alias to be executed when th user presses the

&quot;S&quot; key.&nbsp; For another example, if you want to bind a chat message to a key,

use this:</p>



<pre>    Say &quot;Come get some!&quot;</pre>



<p>In addition, you can bind multiple actions to a keypress like this, to make the

&quot;S&quot; key both jump and say a message.</p>



<pre>    Jump | Say &quot;Come get some!&quot;</pre>



<p>You can also bind an action to the release of a key by using the OnRelease keyword. For

example, you can make the &quot;S&quot; key fire when it's released:</p>



<pre>    OnRelease Fire</pre>



<p>Or you can make the key jump when pressed, and fire when released:</p>



<pre>    Jump | OnRelease Fire</pre>



<p>Keys can be bound to any of the following kinds of things: 



<ul>

  <li>Any console command in the above lists.</li>

  <li>Any key alias (explained below).</li>

  <li>Any special input command.</li>

</ul>



<p>&quot;Special input command&quot; refers to console commands which only make sense in

conjunction with the press or release of a key, or the movement of the mouse or joystick

along an axis. The special input commands are: 



<ul>

  <li>BUTTON &lt;UnrealScript boolean variable name&gt;, for example &quot;BUTTON bFire&quot;:

    Maps a button to an UnrealScript variable stored in the Pawn class or any subclass. &nbsp;

    This tells the input system to automatically set the variable to True when the key is held

    down, and False when it's not pressed.&nbsp; For example, the Pawn script looks at bFire

    to tell whether the fire button is being held.&nbsp; The setting of bFire is not some

    hardcoded behavior of the engine, rather it is propagated into UnrealScript code by the

    input system, as a result of binding a key to &quot;BUTTON bFire&quot;.</li>

  <li>TOGGLE &lt;UnrealScript boolean variable name&gt;, for example &quot;TOGGLE bLook&quot;:

    Like the BUTTON command, but simply tells the input system to toggle the boolean

    variable's value when the key is pressed.</li>

  <li>AXIS &lt;UnrealScript floating point variable name&gt; &lt;SPEED=some number&gt;, for

    example &quot;Axis aStrafe Speed=-300.0&quot;. Maps an analog input axis movement to an

    UnrealScript variable, scaling it by some factor.&nbsp; The current axis keys listed in

    the Advanced Options menu are: MouseX, MouseY, MouseW (Intellimouse wheel), JoyX, JoyY,

    JoyZ, JoyR (joystick rudder), JoyU, JoyV (joystick alternate axis for example the Panther

    XL trackball). Supported PlayerPawn axes are aBaseX, aBaseY (base movements which are

    translated to rotating, strafing, looking, and forward movement based on context),

    aMouseX, aMouseY, aForward, aTurn, aStrafe, aUp (not used), aLookUp, aExtra0-aExtra4 (not

    used). To see how the game code processes movement, see the PlayerPawn class's PlayerInput

    and PlayerTick functions.</li>

</ul>



<p>In addition to the Advance Options menu, you can also bind keys from the console using

the following command:</p>



<pre>	SET INPUT &lt;keyname&gt; &lt;binding&gt;</pre>



<p>For example:</p>



<pre>	SET INPUT X Fire

	SET INPUT Enter Fire</pre>



<h3>Unreal Key Aliases</h3>



<p>Key aliases are listed in Advanced Options / Advanced / Input Aliases.&nbsp; Aliases

provide a convenient way to map one word (for example, &quot;Jump&quot;) to a complex

series of console commands that carry out a particular action.&nbsp; For example, the

&quot;Fire&quot; alias is defined as: &quot;Fire | Button bFire&quot;.&nbsp; This has the

effect of calling the UnrealScript &quot;PlayerPawn.Fire&quot; function (aliases are not

recursive), and then causing the input button bJump to be set to True as long as the key

is held.</p>
