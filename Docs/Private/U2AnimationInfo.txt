Further Notes:

Frame lengths and rates:  These are all variable, and depend entirely on your 
own character needs for animation.  There is no set limit, other than what 
looks good to you barring a few instances of timing, like firing a weapon, or 
changing it.  Generally we followed a pretty similar frameset for all the 
characters with only minor variations in rates and framecounts.  If you need 
reference just open up the ukx files in Ued.  The animation properties tab 
gives the framerate for whatever sequence you select from the left hand list.
Frame counts are listed beside each animation sequence.  Have fun and go 
crazy with your own.

All of the skeletons use a limited, hard coded form of spine control that 
links the upper torso to the player's first person POV.  This gives a better 
indication of where a player may be looking or aiming when viewed in game in 
third person.  Affected animations include all crouches, runs, walks, weapon 
firing, turning, and weapon idles.  It also enables limited blending of 
multiple animations such as running, while firing at the same time.  In order 
to do this the root node or COM in Character Studio's Biped was not keyframed 
for these animations so that the code could blend more smoothly.  

Death animations are basically never seen in game unless you turn karma 
physics off entirely.

Jump sequences are animated in a single scene file and broken down on export 
into Takeoff, Mid, and Land respectively.  Dodges, Double Jumps and 
Walldodges all flow from and back into the Jumps.  See sequence notes above.

Gesture_Taunts and Idle_Character are extra animations that were used in UC 
for specific in-character animations, ie. egyptians doing egyptian-like 
things and nightmares doing... freakier things.  Feel free to use them in 
your own characters.

Slide poses are no longer used in the final game.  They were a failed attempt 
at a blending solution between running animations.  You don't need them in 
your custom character setups.

Some general Unreal Engine info for convenience...

*To convert unreal units to max units, multiply all unreal units by using the 
unreal conversion number. Unreal conversion number = 1 / player scale in 
unreal. Unreal scale is 0.4 of max scale. Thus multiple all following numbers 
by 2.5*

Unreal World Origin = MAX + 90 degrees Z axis

Unreal Rotation:
360 degrees = 65536 = 2^16
 90 degrees = 16384

jump 60			- height
double jump 130	- height

run 440			- 100% full speed
walk 176		- 40 % speed
crouch 110		- 25 % speed

dodge 650		- after dodge speed is 0 in 0 sec. player must accelerate again
				- Dodge time = 1/2 sec
				- 0.1 sec tween to dodge anim after dodge initiated

air times baby...
jump: 0.72 of a sec
dodge: 0.45
dub jump: 1.25


Weapon switch		-0.6 sec  0.1 tween 0.5 sec anim time


From Jus10:

"tweening into a ready or idle pose is 0.25, tweenign into anything else is 0.1. 
simple. tweening always happens at the start of an animation."

Tween happens at beginning of animation
e.g. if dodge is 1/2 and being animated at 30 fps
dodge is called, tween to first frame in 0.1 sec, play dodge.
therefore, animated dodge time is actually only 0.4 seconds, or 12 frames

Idle_Character01  Character specific Idle sequences in UC, played intermittently from Idle_Rest
idle_chat         Indicates player is typing a message.  Headset/wrist communicator use in progress.
*idle_taunt01     Redundant... replaced with character specific Gesture_Taunts in UC

gesture_Taunt01  Character specific taunts used in UC.

*RunF_cjs    Like the normal run, but body more vertical, weapon held quite high - redundant?
*RunL_new    Run left, body twisted to face forward (not a crab walk). lead on left leg, weapon held high - redundant?
*RunR_new    Run right, body twisted to face forward (not a crab walk). lead on right leg, weapon held high - redundant?
*RunF_new    Like the normal run, but body more vertical, weapon held like rifle - redundant?

(swimming animations aren't used but work afaik, at least in standalone games)
